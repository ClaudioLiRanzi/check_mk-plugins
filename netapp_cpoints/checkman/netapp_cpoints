description:
 This check uses SNMP to report the number of Consistency Points of a Netapp.
 A CP is triggered whenever the Filesystem reaches a point where it wants to 
 update the physical data on the disks, with whatever has accumulated in 
 Cache (and was journaled in NVRAM). You can specify individual Thresholds for
 every Type of CP.

{Type Explanation form mib:}
 
Back to Back ({cpFromCpOps}) - If you are getting these, your filer is 
 overloaded. The write traffic is coming in faster than it can be written and 
 the filer is running out of NVRAM capacity in one bank before the data in the
 other bank can be written. We got some of these during a RAID reconstruct. 
{default Threshold: (30, 50)}
 
 Deferred Back to Back ({cpFromCpDeferredOps}) - these are a worse version 
 of the above. Definitely an overload problem.
{default Threshold: (30, 50)}
 
 Timer ({cpFromTimerOps}) - 10 seconds since the last CP – it means the system
 is pretty idle write-wise. Note that lightly writing to a NetApp may lead to 
 more fragmentation than writing a bit more at a time, as it does not get the 
 opportunity to stack stripes. Exercise is good.
 
 Flush ({cpFromFlushOps}) - a flush happened. I’m sure it cleared something away.
 
 High Water ({cpFromHighWaterOps}) - the number of RAM buffers holding modified 
 data exceeded a threshold. Heavy write activity.

 Log Full ({cpFromLogFullOps}) - the current NVRAM bank is full and the system 
 switches to the other one and starts writing this to disk. Very heavy write activity.
 
 Low Water ({cpFromLowWaterOps}) - the number of available RAM buffers dropped 
 below a threshold.
 
 Low Datavec ({cpFromLowDatavecsOps}) - the number of available datavecs 
 (data vectors?) dropped below a threshold.
 
 Low Vbuf ({cpFromLowVbufOps}) - the number of available virtual buffers 
 dropped below a threshold.
 
 Snapshot ({cpFromSnapshotOps}) - snapshots happen. It is a NetApp. 
 Usually triggers a bunch of Sync (Z) CPs.
 
 Sync ({cpFromSyncOps}) - an internal sync – usually preparing to complete a snapshot.
