title: Check for (security) updates via Zypper
agents: linux
catalog: os/misc
license: GPL
distribution: seppovic
description:
 This check checks for available updates via {zypper} and SLES
 and OPENSUSE distributions. You need to install the plugin {mk_zypper}
 into the {plugins} directory of your agent.

 This plugin extends the zypper check shipped with check_mk. It lets you configure thresholds for
 updates (<=SLES11.4 recommended and security; >=SLES12.1 important and critical), the maximum duration security updates can be available until a warning or
 critical state is raised and the status a packagelock should raise.


inventory:
 One service will be created for each system where the {mk_zypper}
 plugin produces a non-empty output.
