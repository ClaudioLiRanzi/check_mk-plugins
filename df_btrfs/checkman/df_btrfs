description:
 This check monitors special cases of btrfs when it comes to data and metadata
 allocation. Misbalanced Metadata can lead to - No space left on device - errors,
 that prevents writing new data even if there is enough space left according to {df}
 output. A very in depth explanation of the problem can be found here:
 {http://marc.merlins.org/perso/btrfs/post_2014-05-04_Fixing-Btrfs-Filesystem-Full-Problems.html} .
 Currently there is only one additional logic implemented in addition to {df} check that 
 test for misbalanced metadata in the following way:

 If at least one device in the {btrfs fi show} output is fully utilised like this:

   -> ...

   -> devid    1 size {133.04GB} used {133.04GB} path /dev/sdf

   -> ...

 and more then {73%} respectively {75%} of the Metadata space in {btrfs fi df /mount/point} 
 output:

   -> ...

   -> System: total=4.00MB, used=0.00

   -> Metadata, DUP: total={3.00GB}, used={2.32GB}      # ~77.33%

   -> ...

 is used, a warn respectively critical state is raised. Threshold is taken from btrfs wiki, 
 it can't be configured.

 The check is fully compatible with {df} with respect to its configuration,
 output and logic. Please refer to the manual of {df} for details.
