 This Plugin is actually a script to cleanup the omd inventory archive. But it is tightly integrated into check_mk
 so it is realized as plugin for the Agent.
 The cleanup follows these rules:
 1. statisfy the files per day constraint (e.g. keep last Report per day)
 2. statisfy the days per month constraint (e.g. keep all Reports left from 1. for the last 3 Months)
 3. statisfy the months per year constraint (e.g. keep all Reports left from 1. and 2. for 1 Year)
 4. statisfy the max year constraint (e.g. delete all reports older than 1 year)
 5. statisfy the max size constraint (e.g. delete all reports, starting with the oldest until we are below 400 MB per folder)

inventory:
 one Service is created for every path in {archivePath} array.
 thresholds cant be defined.
